# üìä Tata GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Virtual Internship

This repository contains my completed tasks from the **Tata iQ x Geldium GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation**.  
The project simulates a real-world use case of identifying at-risk customers, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), proposing predictive modeling strategies, and designing an AI-powered collections system.


## üß† Overview

| Task | Title | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Task 1 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Summary of data quality, missing values, and early risk indicators |
| ‚úÖ Task 2 | Predictive Model Framework | Structured plan for model logic, justification, and evaluation strategy |
| ‚úÖ Task 3 | Stakeholder Report | Two-page report with business recommendation, ethics and fairness considerations |
| ‚úÖ Task 4 | AI Collections System | Executive presentation for autonomous collections strategy |



## ‚úÖ Task Summaries

### üìå Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Reviewed Geldium's dataset using GenAI to identify:
  - Missing values
  - Key anomalies
  - Early risk indicators for delinquency
- Cleaned data and proposed imputation strategies.
- Highlighted 3 most predictive features influencing risk.

### üìå Task 2: Predictive Model Framework
- Chose appropriate models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
- Outlined data pipeline: input ‚Üí preprocessing ‚Üí prediction ‚Üí evaluation.
- Justified model based on interpretability, scalability, and fairness.
- Proposed evaluation using F1-score, AUC, fairness metrics.

### üìå Task 3: Stakeholder Report
- Provided a non-technical 2-page summary.
- Translated data insights into SMART business recommendations.
- Addressed fairness, explainability, and responsible AI usage.

### üìå Task 4: AI-Powered Collections System
- Designed a conceptual architecture for a responsible AI system.
- Defined:
  - System logic (data input ‚Üí prediction ‚Üí human oversight loop)
  - Agentic AI roles (autonomous vs. manual)
  - Ethical safeguards
  - Business KPIs (delinquency reduction, fairness, CX improvement)



## üöÄ Tools Used
- üí¨ GenAI tools: ChatGPT, DeepSeek for EDA & modeling insights
- üìà PowerPoint for final executive presentation
- üßÆ Excel & Word for modeling frameworks and reports
